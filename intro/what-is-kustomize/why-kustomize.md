Configuration management is hard!.

Some key benefits of kustomize that standout among other available solutions include:
- Super fast generation: Template-free makes generation faster.
- Easy to debug: Pure YAML inputs and outputs.
- Reusability: Declare a base and build as many variants of that base as needed.
- No Setup Needed: If you use Kubectl higher that v1.14, then you have kustomize already.
